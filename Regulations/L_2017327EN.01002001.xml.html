The use of biometrics, despite its impact on the privacy of travellers, is justified for two reasons. First, biometrics are a reliable method of identifying third-country nationals who are present on the territory of the Member States but not in possession of travel documents or any other means of identification, a common situation for irregular migrants. Second, biometrics allow for a more reliable matching of entry and exit data of bona fide travellers. The use of facial images in combination with fingerprint data makes it possible to reduce the total number of fingerprints required to be registered, while enabling the same result in terms of accuracy of the identification.</p>

The fingerprints of visa-holding third-country nationals should be checked against the VIS. The facial image of both visa-exempt and visa holding third-country nationals should be registered in the EES. Fingerprints or facial images should be used as a biometric identifier for verifying the identity of third–country nationals who have been previously registered in the EES, for as long as their individual files have not been deleted.
