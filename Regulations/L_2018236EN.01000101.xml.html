Among them are the fact that border authorities at external Schengen borders have no information on travellers exempt from the requirement of being in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders (‘the visa requirement’). The Communication of 6 April 2016 announced that the Commission was to launch a study on the feasibility of establishing a European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). The feasibility study was completed in November 2016. The system would determine the eligibility of visa-exempt third-country nationals prior to their travel to the Schengen Area, and whether such travel poses a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk.</p>
